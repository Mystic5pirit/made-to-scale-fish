# made-to-scale-fish
 A game made for GMTK 2024 Game Jam

 All Rights Reserved.

 This game is an incremental game where the player scales fish. The player collects scales and money to spend on upgrades. Over time the scales take more pressed to collect, this is ofset by upgrades.

 In the case that I continue to work on this game, I plan on adding rare scales that have various effects.
